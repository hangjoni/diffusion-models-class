# DreamBooth Hackathon üèÜ

Welcome to the DreamBooth Hackathon! This is a community event where you'll **personalise a Stable Diffusion model by fine-tuning it on a handful of your own images.** To do so, you'll use a powerful technique called [_DreamBooth_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242), which allows one to implant a subject (e.g. your pet or favourite dish) into the output domain of the model such that it can be synthesized with a _unique identifier_ in the prompt.

This competition is composed of 5 _themes_, where each theme will collect models belong to the following categories:

* **Animal üê®:** Use this theme to generate images of your pet or favourite animal hanging out in the Acropolis, swimming, or flying in space.
* **Science üî¨:** Use this theme to generate cool synthetic images of galaxies, proteins, or any domain of the natural and medical sciences.
* **Food üçî:** Use this theme to tune Stable Diffusion on your favourite dish or cuisine.
* **Landscape üèî:** Use this theme to generate beautiful landscapes of your favourite mountain, lake, or garden.
* **Wildcard üî•:** Use this theme to go wild and create Stable Diffusion models for any category of your choosing!

We'll be **giving out prizes to the top 3 most liked models per theme**, and you're encouraged to submit as many models as you want! 

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to take part in this event:

1. Join the [Hugging Face Discord server](https://huggingface.co/join/discord) and check out the `#dreambooth-hackathon` channel to stay up to date with the event.
2. Launch and run the [DreamBooth notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class/blob/main/hackathon/dreambooth.ipynb) to train your models by clicking on one of the links below. Make sure you select the GPU runtime in each platform to ensure your models train fast!

## Evaluation & Leaderboard

To be in the running for the prizes, push one or more DreamBooth models to the Hub with the `dreambooth-hackathon` tag in the model card ([example](https://huggingface.co/lewtun/ccorgi-dog/blob/main/README.md#L9)). This is created automatically by the [DreamBooth notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class/blob/main/hackathon/dreambooth.ipynb), but you'll need to add it if you're running your own scripts.

Models are evaluated according to the number of likes they have and you can track your model's ranking on the hackathon's leaderboard:

* [DreamBooth Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dreambooth-hackathon/leaderboard)

* **December 21, 2022** - Start date
* **December 31, 2022** - Colab Pro registration deadline
* **January 22, 2023** - Final submissions deadline (closing of the leaderboard)
